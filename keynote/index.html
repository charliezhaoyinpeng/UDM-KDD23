                <strong>Short bio</strong>: Dr. Christopher A. White is the President of NEC Laboratories America where he leads a team of world-class researchers focusing on diverse topics from sensing to networking to machine learning based understanding. Prior to joining NEC he spent 22 years working at Bell Labs where he led the Algorithms, Analytics, Augmented Intelligence and Devices (AAAID) research lab. He joined Bell Labs in 1997 after graduating with a Ph.D. in theoretical quantum chemistry from the University of California in Berkeley, California. His research interests include the development of computational models and methods for the simulation and control of interesting physical and digital systems. This has included work in areas ranging from linear scaling quantum chemistry simulations, to the design of new optical devices, to the global control of transparent optical mesh networks and to understanding and facilitating the propagation of ideas in organizations. In addition to the management of a team of world-class researchers, Dr. White's current work focuses on the creation of assisted thinking tools that leverage structural similarity in data with the goal of augmenting human intelligence.
