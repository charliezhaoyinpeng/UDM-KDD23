                <strong>Short bio</strong>: Dr. Anthony Hoogs coordinates AI activities across the company and leads Kitware’s Computer Vision Team, which he founded when he joined Kitware in 2007. For more than two decades, he has supervised and performed research in various areas of computer vision including: ethical and explainable AI; media forensics; event, activity and behavior recognition; deep learning; object detection, recognition and tracking; and content-based retrieval. He has led dozens of projects, sponsored by commercial companies and government entities including DARPA, AFRL, ONR, I-ARPA and NGA, that range from basic, academic research to developing advanced prototypes and demonstrations installed at operational facilities. He has been the overall Principal Investigator on multiple large DARPA programs, where he was responsible for overseeing collaborations with more than 25 universities and more than ten commercial subcontractors. At GE Global Research (1998-2007), Dr. Hoogs led a team of researchers in video and imagery analysis on projects sponsored by the US Government, Lockheed Martin and NBC Universal. He has served on technical panels for DARPA, NSF, NOAA and the National Academies, including DARPA Information Science and Technology (ISAT) panels in 2007, 2009 and 2013 and as an ISAT member 2018-2020. In 2019 he served as the lead organizer for an ISAT study on ethical reasoning in computational autonomy. Dr. Hoogs received a Ph.D. in Computer and Information Science from the University of Pennsylvania in 1998. He has published more than 80 papers in computer vision, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence and remote sensing. His academic service includes General Chair and Program Chair roles for major computer vision conferences such as the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition and the IEEE Winter conference on Applications of Computer Vision. He has co-organized more than ten workshops at major AI conferences. He regularly serves as an Area Chair and on program committees for the primary computer vision and AI conferences and workshops.

                <strong>Short bio</strong>: Dr. Christopher A. White is the President of NEC Laboratories America where he leads a team of world-class researchers focusing on diverse topics from sensing to networking to machine learning based understanding. Prior to joining NEC he spent 22 years working at Bell Labs where he led the Algorithms, Analytics, Augmented Intelligence and Devices (AAAID) research lab. He joined Bell Labs in 1997 after graduating with a Ph.D. in theoretical quantum chemistry from the University of California in Berkeley, California. His research interests include the development of computational models and methods for the simulation and control of interesting physical and digital systems. This has included work in areas ranging from linear scaling quantum chemistry simulations, to the design of new optical devices, to the global control of transparent optical mesh networks and to understanding and facilitating the propagation of ideas in organizations. In addition to the management of a team of world-class researchers, Dr. White's current work focuses on the creation of assisted thinking tools that leverage structural similarity in data with the goal of augmenting human intelligence.
