    <h2>Topic of interest (including but not limited to)</h2>
    <p>
        This workshop will provide a premium platform for both research and industry from different backgrounds to exchange ideas on opportunities, challenges, and cutting-edge techniques in ethical AI. We encourage submissions in various degrees of progress, such as new results, visions, techniques, innovative application papers, and progress reports under the topics that include, but are not limited to, the following broad categories:
    </p>

        <ul>
          <li style="list-style-type:square">Uncertainty quantification in classification and regression </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:square">Out-of-distribution detection </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:square">Conditional reasoning with uncertainty </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:square">Quantification of multidimensional uncertainty </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:square">Sequential uncertainty estimation </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:square">Interpretation of uncertainty </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:square">Uncertainty-aware deep reinforcement learning </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:square">Decision-making with uncertainty </li>
        </ul>

    <p>
        And with particular focuses but not limited to these application domains:
    </p>

        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type:square">Application of uncertainty methods in large-scale data mining </li>
            <li style="list-style-type:square">Computer vision (uncertainty in face recognition, object relation) </li>
            <li style="list-style-type:square">Natural language processing (language uncertainty, sentence uncertainty) </li>
            <li style="list-style-type:square">Reinforcement learning (uncertainty-aware offline reinforcement learning exploration vs. exploitation) </li>
        </ul>


    <h2>CFP Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
        Submissions are limited to a total of 5 pages, including all content and references, and must be in PDF format and use AAAI templates (two column format). Acknowledgements should be omitted from papers submitted for review. See AAAI-23 author kit for details at <a href="https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-23/submission-guidelines/">https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-23/submission-guidelines/</a>. Papers must be in trouble-free, high-resolution PDF format, formatted for US Letter (8.5″ x 11″) paper, using Type 1 or TrueType fonts. AAAI submissions are anonymous and must conform to the instructions (detailed below) for double-blind review. The authors must remove all author and affiliation information from their submission for review, and may replace it with other information, such as paper number and keywords.

    </p>
    <p>
        Submitted papers will be assessed based on their novelty, technical quality, potential impact, and clarity of writing. For papers that rely heavily on empirical evaluations, the experimental methods and results should be clear, well-executed, and repeatable. Authors are strongly encouraged to make data and code publicly available whenever possible. The accepted papers will be posted on the workshop website but will not be included in the AAAI proceedings. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Submit your paper through the UDM-AAAI workshop CMT submission site: <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/UDM2023/Submission/Index"> https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/UDM2023/Submission/Index</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Upon notification, we ask that authors of accepted works deanonymize their papers, make any final changes, and then submit a camera-ready version to the CMT submission site.  The workshop website will then be updated with links to accepted papers. Note that accepted works will not be formally published. This means that:
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type:square">Authors can retain full copyright of their works </li>
            <li style="list-style-type:square">Work contained in accepted papers are not precluded to be published in other research venues </li>
            <li style="list-style-type:square">Submitted papers are allowed to have significant overlap with previously published or currently submitted work (in this case, please indicate overlapping works). </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Attendance</h2>
    <p>
        For each accepted paper, at least one author must attend the conference and present the paper.
